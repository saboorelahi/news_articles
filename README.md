# Getting Started with NEWS app

After installing docker use the command

### `docker-compose up --build`

--------

 If docker cause any issue, use the command

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

--------

NewsAPI, Newyork times API are integerated, tried using Guardian but that need proper work email to get the access code,
so tried GNEWS api (https://gnews.io/docs/v4#top-headlines-endpoint), but the number of requests per day is limited so commented
the code but implementation is there. For first two NewsAPI, Newyork times, its working.

Some further improvements can be made as per time need.
